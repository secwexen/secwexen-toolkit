**A curated collection of offensive, defensive, and automation tools developed for cybersecurity research, penetration testing, and threat analysis.**

This repository serves as a central hub for my custom-built security utilities, written in **Python**, **Rust**, **Bash**, and **PowerShell**.  
Each tool is designed for real-world workflows, focusing on efficiency, clarity, and practical use in controlled environments.

---

## Features 

- Offensive security scripts for recon, enumeration, and exploitation  
- Defensive utilities for log analysis, threat hunting, and incident response  
- OSINT automation tools for intelligence gathering  
- Rust-based CLI tools for performance-critical tasks  
- Python-based automation for SIEM, parsing, and data processing  
- Bash & PowerShell helpers for system diagnostics and workflow optimization  

---

## Technologies 

- **Python** — automation, parsing, threat intel  
- **Rust** — high-performance security tooling  
- **Bash** — Linux workflow automation  
- **PowerShell** — Windows diagnostics & IR  
- **Linux** — primary development environment
